# Mandelbrot explorer: GPU Edition

This is a mandelbrot set explorer running as a shader on your GPU. The controls require a
keyboard. You can read more about the project and [try it out online](https://rileyjshaw.com/mandelbrot).

This is a quick project I threw together to generate shallow mandelbrot zooms. It's not precious, so please [add pull requests](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/mandelbrot/pulls) if you have ideas! Iâ€™ll merge changes quickly as long as the app remains reasonably performant.
