# Julia Set Explorer: GPU Edition

This is a Julia set explorer running as a shader on your GPU. The full controls require a keyboard and mouse. You can read more about the project and [try it out online](https://rileyjshaw.com/julia).

This is a quick project I threw together to generate shallow Julia zooms. It's not precious, so please [add pull requests](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/julia/pulls) if you have ideas! Iâ€™ll merge changes quickly as long as the app remains reasonably performant.
